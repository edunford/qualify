Manual data entry is a messy process; moreover, we rarely if ever record and assess the meta data that underpins manual coding entry when evaluating data quality. We propose building a tool that streamlines data generation, logs entries, track changes and editors, and eases the transfer from raw data entry into a analyzable data frame. We have a proof of concept. The aim would be to compartmentalize the construction of unique applications using a modular coding structure that allows users to build their applications additively (think the ggplot of purposed shiny applications).
