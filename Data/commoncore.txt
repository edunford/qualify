(*) Fields have one explicit decimal place, unless otherwise noted.

(+) Fields represent sub-fields of the fields immediately preceding them.

The file contains data for school year 2008–09, sorted by the NCES-assigned local education agency identification code (LEAID).
Data presented in this release are available in two formats—SAS datasets (.sas7bdat) and tab-separated values text files (.txt).

Note that starting with the 2002–03 CCD, all numeric fields contain a -1 to indicate missing and a -2 to indicate not applicable.
Previously, numeric fields contained an “M” to indicate missing and an “N” to indicate not applicable. Character fields continue
to use “M” for missing and “N” for not applicable.

UNION08		17	AN	Supervisory union number.  For supervisory union administrative centers and component agencies, this is  
                                  a number assigned by the state to the union. Additionally, if the agency is a county superintendent,  
                                  this is the FIPS county number. If no number was reported, the field will contain “000.”

CONUM08		18	AN	FIPS county number (two digit FIPS state numeric code + three digits FIPS county code) based on the  
                                  location of the administrative office. FIPS county number.

CONAME08	19	AN	County name based on the location of the administrative office.

CSA08		20	AN	Combined Statistical Area (CSA). The CSA assignment is based on the CSA assignments of schools  
                                  associated with the agency, weighted by the number of students in each school. A CSA may comprise  
                                  two or more metropolitan statistical areas, a metropolitan statistical area and a micropolitan  
                                  statistical area, two or more micropolitan statistical areas, or multiple metropolitan and micropolitan  
                                  statistical areas. If the school(s) used to weight the assignment are not within a CSA, the field will  
                                  be assigned an "N" (not applicable).

				  NOTE: Starting in 2006–07, this field contains the CSA code for all areas. Prior to 2006–07, this field  
                                  contained the New England City and Town Areas (NECTA) codes for agencies in the New England States.

CBSA08		21	AN	Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA). A value in this field indicates that the agency's address is associated  
                                  with a recognized population nucleus and adjacent communities that have a high degree of integration  
                                  with that nucleus, and designated by the U.S. Government as a metropolitan or micropolitan statistical  
                                  area. The integration of adjacent communities is determined by the CBSAs of schools associated with the  
                                  agency, weighted by the number of students in each school.  If the agency is not in any type of  
                                  metropolitan/micropolitan statistical area the field contains an "N" (not applicable). 

				  NOTE: Starting in 2006–07, this field contains the CBSA code for all areas. Prior to 2006–07, this  
                                  field contained the NECTA codes for agencies in the New England States. This assignment was made using  
                                  a file of FIPS county codes matched to CBSA codes. 

METMIC08	22	AN	Indicates whether the CBSA is a metropolitan or micropolitan area.

				0 = CBSA is equal to 70,300 or higher and does not have an associated type code. CBSA equal to 70,300 or  
                                    higher is NECTA and is not denoted as metropolitan or micropolitan. 

				1= CBSA is a metropolitan area.

				2 = CBSA is a micropolitan area.

ULOCAL08	23	AN	NCES urban-centric locale code.

				NOTE: Starting in 2006–07, CCD data files contain a new locale code system that is based on the urbanity of  
                                  the agency location. In prior years, the locale was assigned based on an agency's metro status.  
                                  See appendix C, Glossary for more detail.

				11 = City, Large Territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with population of

				12 = City, Mid-size Territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with a population  
                                     less than 250,000 and greater than or equal to 100,000.

				13 = City, Small Territory inside an urbanized area and inside a principal city with a population

                                     250,000 or more.

				22 = Suburb, Mid-size Territory outside a principal city and inside an urbanized area with a population  
                                     less than 250,000 and greater than or equal to 100,000.

				23 = Suburb, Small Territory outside a principal city and inside an urbanized area with a population

				42 = Rural, Distant Census-defined rural territory that is more than 5 miles but less than or equal to  
                                     25 miles from an urbanized area, as well as rural territory that is more than 2.5 miles but less  
                                     than or equal to 10 miles from an urban cluster.

				43 = Rural, Remote Census-defined rural territory that is more than 25 miles from an urbanized area and  
                                     is also more than 10 miles from an urban cluster

CDCODE08	24	AN	Congressional district code based on location of administrative office. FIPS numeric code for the  
                                  congressional districts that are legislatively defined subdivision of the state for the purpose of  
                                  electing representatives to the House of Representative of the United States Congress. The first two  
                                  digits are the FIPS state numeric code, which makes the congressional district code unique across states  
                                  (see Appendix C Glossary for detail). If an agency serves more than one congressional district, the code  
                                  represents the primary one.

LATCOD08	25*	N	Latitude. Based on the location of the administrative office, the value of LATCOD ranges from 17 to 71.  
                                  It contains an explicit decimal point. The digits to the left of the decimal represent the number of  
                                  degrees from the equator; the digits to the right of the decimal represent the fraction of the next  
                                  degree carried out to six decimal places.

LONCOD08	26*	N	Longitude. Based on the location of the administrative office, the value of LONCOD ranges from -65 to -177.  
                                  The minus sign (-) indicates west of the prime meridian. It contains an explicit decimal point. The digits  
                                  to the left of the decimal point represent the number of degrees from the prime meridian; the digits to  
                                  the right of the decimal point represent the fraction of the next degree carried out to six decimal places.

BOUND08		27	AN	The boundary change indicator is a classification of changes in an education agency’s boundaries since the  
                                  last report to NCES. The options are as follows:

				1 = No significant boundary change for this agency since the last report.  Currently in operation.

				2 = Education agency has closed with no effect on another agency’s boundaries. 

				3 = This is a new education agency formed with no effect on another agency’s boundaries.

                                    now being added.

				5 = Agency has undergone a significant change in geographic boundaries or instructional responsibility.

GSHI08		29	AN	Agency high grade offered. If grade span data were not reported, this field was calculated from the  
                                  high grade spans of the associated schools in the CCD school universe file. When combined, GSLO and  
                                  GSHI are the grade span of the school.
